title: My First Ever 24 Hour Hackathon
---

I recently got to attend my first 24 hour long hackathon. And by recently, I mean in January. I had the opportunity to compete with team - Prem, Ajay and Mithun and we went head-first into the competition. We had spend the previous night working on frontend and backend boilerplates for a full-stack application that would come in handy given the expected quality of our product in 24 hours. We set a benchmark for ourselves and decided to hold ourselves to the standards we've held ourselves to for other projects.

The event started at around 2 p.m. after the inaugural formalities. We received the problem statements soon, and were given the choice to either choose one of the 14 problems given, or solve an already existing societal issue. We chose to tackle one the given problem statements, which was inventing a solution to bring education to kids in rural areas.

After a brief discussion, we decided that a mobile-first webapp would be the way to go. Our goal was creating an educational app that tailors content to a child's learning style. The app was designed to teach children math, science and even regional languages. 

Given that the app needed to reach rural students, we implemented a translation feature that translated selected text from English to a regional language of the student's choice. 

There were multiple rounds of judgement and we had the feeling that we managed to impress each one of the judges. Even the other students participating in the event had a keen eye on our project and were eager to see the end result. We ended up bagging the third prize and a special mention from the event hosts.

Beyond the silverware we won, I felt like we had gained something more precious that day. Having come from a cutthroat environment both in school and in college, I had always felt some degree of impostor syndrome - a deep feeling in the gut telling that I wasn't good enough to be where I am. However, this event changed my perspective on it. A lot of students from other colleges, colleges that the general public wouldn't consider to be as "prestigious" as my institution approached us with a genuine glint in their eyes, curious about how we'd managed to build such an app in less than 24 hours. I stayed up until 6 a.m. the next morning, and I promised myself to greet each visitor to our desk with equal warmth.  

When my other teammates were asleep, I was grappling around to find a working LLM for the translation service. At around 4 a.m., a couple of students from the host institution approached our desk and I took a whole 10 minutes to explain the working of our product. I've always loved to educate curious people and this came as a special opportunity. 

Beyond explaining our work, we managed to connect with a lot of like-minded people our age. The students in the organizing team were helpful even at hours past midnight, and one particular student - Yohesh - had a liking to our team from the beginning and it was only in the end of the event that we learnt that he was the secretary of the organizing committee.

I sincerely believe that my team and I were able to open a few peoples' eyes to the world of development, and problem solving for the less fortunate. Overall, it was a great experience and we had no regrets staying up for an entire night. We even promised ourselves that we'd return the next year with the same enthusiasm and energy.
